Asteroids.py

## Project summary

Asteroids.py will be a basic 2D animated game. The overall premise is to fly your spaceship around and destroy asteroids.

### Instructions
* Use the UP arrow to engage thrusters
* Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows to rotate your ship
* Use the SPACEBAR to shoot lasers
* Shoot the asteroids to destroy them, dodge them to stay alive
* You only get 5 lives! Good luck :)

### Goals
* get Game class built w/ associated background
* get the main() function built
* get the spaceship sprite built, instantiate w/ Game class
* get the bullet sprite built, instantiate w/ Game class
* get LblScore class built & build the label for score
* get LblLives class built & build the label for lives
* get Intro class built

### Process Description

* I learned a lot about dealing with producing multiple sprites and using them for collisions
* I got stuck on the Spacehip sprite a lot. I really wanted to add a drag effect, could not figure this out.
* I would like to add 2 smaller asteroid sprites that spawn when the larger is destroyed
* I would also like to add a process or similar thing to avoid the asteroids from spawning on the spaceship, this causes you to lose a life
* Aside from not getting the smaller asteroid to spawn, I did not stray far from the GDD
* Staying on track for this project wasn’t entirely difficult. I rarely caught myself caring about “wouldn’t it be cool if” and really focused on the mechanics of the game
