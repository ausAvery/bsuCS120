print(f"Is this the real life? Is this just {descriptiveNoun}?\nCaught in a {geographicalDisaster}, no escape from reality\nOpen your {bodyPart}, {actionVerb} up to the skies and see\nI'm just a {adjective} {gender}, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the {element} blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n{parentFigure}, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now {pronoun}'s dead\n{parentFigure}, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all {adverb}\n{parentFigure}, ooh, didn't mean to make you {emotion}\nIf I'm not back again this time {weekday}\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters")
